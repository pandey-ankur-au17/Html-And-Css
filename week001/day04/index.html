                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
                    I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I’m not comfortable with settling,
                    and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.I am highly organised. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I’m always able to find what I need.
                     I find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest of the team stay on track.
